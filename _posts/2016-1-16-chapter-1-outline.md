# Section 1.2 - The Real Line
* Coordinate line
* Inequality rules
	* Either $a<b$, or $b<a$, or $a=b$
	* If $a>b$, then $a+c>b+c$
	* If $a>b$ and $c>0$, then $ac>bc$
	* If $a>b$ and $c<0$, then $ac<bc$
* Intervals
	* Set builder notation: $\\{x\mid a<x<b\\}$
	* Open intervals
	* Closed intervals
	* Unbounded intervals
	* Graphical representation
* Sign charts
* Union and intersection
* Absolute value
	* Distance on the real line (1D)
	* Midpoints on the real line (1D)
* Absolute value properties
	* $\vert ab\vert = \vert a\vert \cdot \vert b\vert$
	* $\left\vert \vert a\vert - \vert b\vert \right\vert \leq \vert a + b\vert \leq \vert a\vert + \vert b\vert$
	* $\vert x\vert < a$ if and only if $-a<x<a$
	* $\vert x\vert > a$ if and only if $x<-a$ or $x>a$

	* Origin
	* $x$-axis
	* $y$-axis

# Section 1.4 - Equations and Graphs

	* Identity
	* Conditional equation
* Graph of an equation
* $x$-intercepts and $y$-intercept (collectively known as axis intercepts)

# Section 1.6 - Functions
* Function / functional relationship
	* Independent variable
	* Dependent variable
	* Box notation
* Domain and range
	* Finding domain and range from a graph
	* Range is not always *possible* to find precisely
* Vertical line test
* Piecewise defined functions
* Rate of change
	* Difference quotient
	* Average rate of change
	* Instantaneous rate of change
* Odd and even and neither functions
	* Even functions have graphs with $y$-axis symmetry. Analytic test: $f(-x)=f(x)$.
	* Odd functions have graphs with origin symmetry. Analytic test: $f(-x)=-f(x)$.
	* Functions do not need to be even or odd. For example $f(x)=x+1$ is neither.
* Local maximums and local minimums

# Section 1.7 - Linear Functions
* Linear relationship / linear function
* Slope of a line
	* Positive slopes
	* Negative slopes
	* Zero slope
* Point-slope form: $y-\color{red}{y_1}=\color{red}{m}(x-\color{red}{x_1})$.
* Slope-intercept form: $y = \color{red}{m}x+\color{red}{b}$.
* In the above, the red variables are what we call **parameters**. They represent fixed quantities, rather than changing ones (like the independent and dependent variables $x$ and $y$ do). For a given problem, we usually want to replace parameters with specific values. This is not true of the variables $x$ and $y$.
* Slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines
	* Parallel lines have the same slope
	* Perpendicular lines have opposite (negative) inverse (reciprocal) slopes
* General linear equation

# Section 1.8 - Quadratic Functions
* Quadratic function
* Parabola
* Horizontal shifts. Let $c>0$.
	* $y = f(x+c)$ is a shift to the left.
	* $y = f(x-c)$ is a shift to the right.
* Vertical shifts. Let $c>0$.
	* $y = f(x) + c$ is a shift up.
	* $y = f(x) - c$ is a shift down.
* Graph of $y=\color{red}{a}x^2$
	* If $a<0$ parabola opens downward
	* If $a>0$ parabola opens upward
	* The larger $\vert a\vert$, the steeper the parabola
* Standard form: $y=\color{red}{a}(x-\color{red}{x_1})^2 + \color{red}{y_1}$
* Quadratic formula: solutions to $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
* End behavior
	* as $x\to\infty$, $f(x)\to$
	* as $x\to-\infty$, $f(x)\to$
